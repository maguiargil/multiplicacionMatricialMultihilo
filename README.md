This repository was created in order to comply with the guidelines provided for the "Operating Systems" course, semester 02-2023 in the University of Antioquia. The chosen course project consists on the implementation of a simple multithreading algorithm having some background and context, which is matrix multiplication.

Two C algorithms for matrix multiplication are hosted in this repository: A single-threading one and a multiple-threading one. The algorithm with multithreading functionality uses Pthreads, an API for multiple threading management.
